 Git isn't the same thing as GitHub. Git is a version-control system (i.e., a piece of software) that helps you keep track of your computer programs and files and the changes that are made to them over time. It also allows you to collaborate with your peers on a program, code, or file. GitHub and similar services (including GitLab and BitBucket) are websites that host a Git server program to hold your code.
